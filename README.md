_Full-Stack with Benefits_ is a community driven blog about (not exclusively) Software Development, Technology and Science. 
Feel free to widen the spectrum of topics, if you feel like (:

## ðŸ—£ Community Driven?

To be part of the community behind this blog you can do the following things:

* **Content Contribution**: create, edit, amend content;
* **Technical Contribution**: pick issues from the board;

### ðŸ“– Content contribution

> ### Please Note
>
> Content contribution is currently on hold. 
>
> This is namely due to the recent Contentful migration for which an Access Control still needs to be figured out. You can follow, vote and provide feedback on this matter - and you're very much encouraged to do so - [here](https://github.com/shikaan/full-stack-with-benefits/issues/31).

### ðŸ’» Technical Contribution

So far this platform has been a one man show. This means that a lot of ideas and features did not have the time to be realized yet and unfortunately some tech debt has been accumulated.

Thankfully, none of that mental work is wasted. All the things that need to be done are collected in the board you can see [here](https://github.com/shikaan/full-stack-with-benefits/issues).

More details [here](.github/TECH.md).
