# What is this about?

_Full-Stack with Benefits_ is a community driven blog about (not exclusively) Software Development, Technology and Science. 
Feel free to widen the spectrum of topics, if you feel like (:

## ðŸ—£ Community Driven?

To be part of the community behind this blog you can do the following things:

* **Content Contribution**: create, edit, amend content;
* **Technical Contribution**: pick issues from the board;

### ðŸ“– Content contribution

All the articles of this blog are simple markdown files in the `content` folder. 

Hence, you can contribute either editing one of those files or you can create a new folder with an `index.md` and take it from there.

More details [here]()

### ðŸ’» Technical Contribution

So far this platform has been a one man show. This means that a lot of ideas and features did not have the time to be realized yet and unfortunately some tech debt has been accumulated.

Thankfully, none of that mental work is wasted. All the things that need to be done are collected in the board you can see [here]().
